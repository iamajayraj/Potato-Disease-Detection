# Attention-based Potato Disease Detection

## Project Overview

This repository is associated with a research paper on an attention-based potato disease detection system. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Transfer Learning, and Attention mechanisms, specifically the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM).

Key features of the project include:
- Enhancement of DenseNet169, MobileNet, XceptionNet, and VGG16 models using attention mechanisms
- Significant parameter reduction (40%-60%) while maintaining similar accuracy
- Optimization of computational efficiency in disease detection

## Publication Status

**Important Notice:** The code for this project is currently not available for public access. The associated research paper has been submitted for review to a scientific journal. 

We anticipate making the code public once the paper has been published. This approach ensures compliance with the journal's policies on pre-publication data sharing.

## Future Updates

We will update this repository with the full code and additional details after the paper's publication. Thank you for your understanding and interest in our research.
